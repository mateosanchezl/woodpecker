# Chess Puzzle Trainer

This is a chess puzzle trainer application built with Next.js and shadcn/ui. It implements the **Woodpecker Method**, a technique designed to improve chess skills by repeatedly solving a set of puzzles. The app adopts a local-first approach, storing all progress data in the browser's local storage, making it easy to use without requiring a backend server.

## Features

- Loads chess puzzles from a local JSON file (`public/puzzles.json`).
- Uses `react-chessboard` for an interactive chess interface and `chess.js` for game logic.
- Persists progress data in local storage, including:
  - Current puzzle index
  - Number of cycles completed
  - Time taken for each puzzle attempt
- Displays a main board area with:
  - A chessboard for solving puzzles
  - Progress indicators
  - A timer
  - Toast notifications for feedback on moves
- Includes a sidebar with:
  - A list of puzzles
  - Status indicators (e.g., "Solved", "Failed", "Unsolved")
  - Puzzle themes and ratings

## Prerequisites

To run the app locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6 or higher)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the app on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-puzzle-trainer.git
   ```

   Replace `yourusername` with the actual GitHub username or repository URL.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd chess-puzzle-trainer
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

Once the installation is complete, you can start the app with the following steps:

- **Start the development server**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Access the app**:
  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

The app should now be running locally, and you can start solving chess puzzles!

## Puzzles Data

The app loads puzzles from a file located at `public/puzzles.json`. This file contains an array of puzzle objects, each with the following structure:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the puzzle.
- `fen`: FEN string representing the starting chess position.
- `solution`: Array of moves in algebraic notation (e.g., `["e2e4", "e7e5"]`).
- `rating`: Difficulty rating of the puzzle.
- `popularity`: Popularity score of the puzzle.
- `themes`: Array of themes or tags (e.g., `["fork", "middlegame"]`).
- `cyclesCompleted`: Number of times the puzzle has been solved in a cycle.
- `times`: Array of times taken to solve the puzzle in each attempt.

You can edit this file to add, remove, or modify puzzles as desired.

## Technology Stack

The app is built using the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework for building the app.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Type safety for JavaScript.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Styling the app.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): Pre-built, customizable UI components.
- [react-chessboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chessboard): Chessboard visualization.
- [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js): Chess logic and move validation.

## Resetting Progress

Since progress is stored in local storage, you can reset it by clearing the relevant data:

- Open your browser's developer tools (e.g., press `F12`).
- Go to the **Application** tab.
- Under **Local Storage**, find and delete the entry for `chessPuzzleProgress`.

Alternatively, run this command in the browser console:

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem("chessPuzzleProgress");
```
